# Overview

The purpose of the analysis is to determine how differing city types can affect the revenues earned by PyBer drivers.

#Results

Rural drivers do the least amount of rides with the lowest amount of drivers, however, due to the spacing of properties in rural areas, they tend to earn a much higher fare per ride.  Given the higher fare per ride, rural drivers tend to also earn much more per capita than the other areas.

Ubran drivers do the most amount of rides with the largest amount of drivers, however, due to the close proximity of properties within ubran areas, they tend to earn a much lower fare per ride.  Given the lower fare per ride, rural drivers tend to also earn much less per capita than the other areas.

Suburban drivers fall in the middle of rural and urban areas in terms of both profitablity metrics and driver count.
