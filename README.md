# Overview

The purpose of the analysis is to determine how differing city types can affect the revenues earned by PyBer drivers.

Results

Rural drivers do the least amount of rides with the lowest amount of drivers, however, due to the spacing of properties in rural areas, they tend to earn a much higher fare per ride.  Given the higher fare per ride, rural drivers tend to also earn much more per capita than the other areas.

Ubran drivers do the most amount of rides with the largest amount of drivers, however, due to the close proximity of properties within ubran areas, they tend to earn a much lower fare per ride.  Given the lower fare per ride, rural drivers tend to also earn much less per capita than the other areas.

Suburban drivers fall in the middle of rural and urban areas in terms of both profitablity metrics and driver count.

Summary

January and February see a varying inverse relationship between fares in urban versus rural areas.  Thus, during these time periods, PyBer should consider reallocating rural resources to urban areas and vice versa according to the surges in ridership.

Towards the end of February, which likely coincides with President's Day weekend, there is a significant spike in ridership across all three city types.  Thus, PyBer should consider bringing in additional resources during this time period to capitalize on the increase in ridership.

There is a downturn in rides for ubran areas heading into May.  This likely coincides with warmer weather and increased walkability for shorter commutes.  During this time, the suburban area is the only area that doesn't see a drop-off in fares, thus PyBer should focus drivers towards suburban areas to capitalize on their continued ridership.
